# Galaxy Mergers Collectively Illuminate the γ-Ray Sky

## Content

**Galaxy merger sample file.csv** – This file contains the list of galaxy mergers (with RA/Dec coordinates) included in our Fermi-LAT gamma-ray analysis. The galaxy mergers were collected from the following eight catalogs: 

- UNION Catalog ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18396))
- Hwang 2009 Catalog ([link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009yCat..21810233H/abstract))
- GOTHIC Catalog ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12177))
- HST Catalog ([link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/491672))
- DND galaxies ([link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/421371))
- Merging Galaxies in the SDSS EDR ([link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/381954))
- GZoo Catalog ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10289))
- Progenitors of massive mergers ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.2157))

**Preprocessing Summary.txt** – This file summarizes the results obtained from the single-source analysis of the selected 1,875 galaxy mergers in this work.
